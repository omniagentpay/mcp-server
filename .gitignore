#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the Python version is
#   controlled by the user.
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having cross-platform versions, pipenv install will fail on a different platform or with
#   a different Python version.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   poetry.lock
#   pyproject.toml is definitely NOT to be ignored.

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock
#   .pdm-python is used by pdm for local configuration, and should be ignored.
